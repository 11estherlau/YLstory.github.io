        <p>[Nature Weak Bottom VS Tsundere cold face Top]</p>
        <p>Shen Shijie woke up and found that he had crossed over, and the funny thing was that he wore it into the

          a simple war scum!!Shen Shijie looked at the attribute panel in front of him and was so frightened that his
          legs instantly weakened, but he didn't know when a very cute little ball appeared behind Shen Shijie, he
          called himself System 001, and the purpose of his coming here was to assist Shen Shijie to change the content
          and ending of the original work, as long as the ending changed, Shen Shijie could return to his own world.In
          the original work, the male protagonist was chased and killed by various forces because of the jealousy of
          others, but unexpectedly, even the father and second sister who affected the family were killed, the eldest
          brother was made to have his legs wasted, and he could only sit in a wheelchair from then on, and the third
          brother was missing and didn't know whether he was alive or dead,The male protagonist couldn't accept the
          death of his father and second sister, so he hid it from his master.,Go alone.,In the end, it's no match for
          all forces to fall. Just when he was dying, he vaguely saw a familiar figure running towards him.....
